# OPENAI Self-Aware Discord Bot
I made this in like 2 minutes but it's still fun to play around with

# Installation

1. Extract the `.zip` to wherever you like
2. Open the folder in command prompt and run `npm install`
3. Configure the `EXAMPLE.env` then rename it to `.env`
4. Run the Bot by typing `node app.js`
